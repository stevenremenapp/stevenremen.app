<img
  aria-hidden="true"
  class="page-border"
  src="/border.svg"
  style="z-index: -1; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;"
/>

## Inspiration

I recently started a screenprinting class at the local art school and fell
in love with the physical printing process, and the freedom and
opportunity for happy mistakes that it allows. In particular, I found
myself interested in the halftone pattern, which we all are likely aware
of (even if we don't know the name) thanks to pop art. Perhaps the most
prominent pop artist to use them was [Roy Lichtenstein](https://www.google.com/search?q=roy+lichtenstein).
I've also been enjoying Ben Rider's screenprint work, and noticed that he sometimes uses halftone patterns as a decorative part of a larger
whole, or other times as a border, like in his Liz poster in the
[Leake Street Mural](https://www.benrider.com/Leake-Street-mural)
. So all off this was in my head, and all the while I've always found a
border on a webpage fun (so much so that my very first portfolio was
nothing but borders within borders).

## Question

How can we make a halftone border around a webpage?

## Process

I know that gradient and image borders via CSS are a thing, so let's start
there. My first attempt was to use a radial gradient as the
border-image-source, essentially making a Frankenstein border combining
the CSS halftone path suggested by Michelle Barker<sup>[1](https://css-irl.info/css-halftone-patterns/)</sup>
and the gradient border path suggested by Chris Coyier<sup>[2](https://css-tricks.com/gradient-borders-in-css/)</sup>.
However, after making it work with border-image: it is not
browser-friendly. Chromium browsers work fine, but Firefox gets weird and
Safari doesn't work at all.

This write-up is still in process :)
