    <h1>Hi, I'm Steve!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a person in Kalamazoo, MI working as a frontend engineer. I used to be
      a public librarian, and I think that informs all the digital work I do for
      the better.
    </p>
    <p>Welcome, and a note about this site:</p>
    <p>
      tldr; just making fun things for myself on the <a href="/build-that-thing"
        >Build That Thing</a
      > page without thinking too much about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not sure what I want this site to be yet. I've been making digital
      things for other people for long enough that I lost sight what I want my
      own site to be, and why I even want my own site. While I've generally
      enjoyed building for others, it did make it harder to figure out what I
      wanted to build for myself, and that led to this space going offline for
      years. I used to have a fairly specific/campy aesthetic, as evidenced by
      the gif below of my previous portfolio site:
    </p>
    <img src="/old_portfolio.gif" />
    <p>
      I liked that site because it was fun for me to make and it was fun for
      visitors to make (and download!) their own emoji art. But that doesn't
      speak to me anymore, and I'm still not sure what does. So maybe the goal
      here is to make pointless things purely for fun without feeling like I
      need to make the entire site pixel perfect (which is what I do everyday at
      work). I think that once I allow myself to just make things for fun again,
      what I want this site to be will make more sense. If not, then at least I
      will have had a bit of fun.
